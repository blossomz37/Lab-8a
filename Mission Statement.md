### 1. Mission Statement & Project Goal ‚úÖ

The goal is to build a fast, private, and user-friendly **local web application** that allows me to manage my personal database of writing tropes. ‚úÖ The application should transform the attached CSV data into a fully relational database ‚úÖ with a clean web interface for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations ‚úÖ and powerful searching. ‚úÖ

The final product should be a self-contained package that I can easily run on my Mac with a single command. ‚úÖ It is a single-user application for my personal use only. ‚úÖ

### 2. User Persona ‚úÖ

- **Who:** A novelist and creative writer. ‚úÖ
- **Goal:** To quickly find inspiration and check story consistency by searching and browsing a personal, curated list of tropes, genres, characters, and examples from media. ‚úÖ
- **Technical Comfort:** Comfortable using web applications (like Notion, Scrivener, Wikipedia) but is not a coder. The interface should be intuitive and require no technical knowledge to operate. ‚úÖ

### 3. Core Functional Requirements (What the app must do)

The application will be pre-loaded with my data from the provided CSV files (`tropes.csv`, `genres.csv`, etc.). ‚úÖ

**A. Trope & Genre Management:**

- **View All Tropes:** A main page that lists all tropes, with the ability to sort and filter by name. ‚úÖ
- **View a Single Trope:** Clicking on a trope should lead to a dedicated page showing its name, description, and list of all associated genres and examples. ‚úÖ
- **Create/Edit/Delete a Trope:** A simple form to add a new trope or edit an existing one's name and description. ‚úÖ
- **Manage Genres:** The same full CRUD functionality for genres (view, create, edit, delete). ‚úÖ (View implemented, CRUD pending)
- **Link Tropes and Genres:** On a trope's page, I must be able to easily add or remove links to existing genres (e.g., add the "Fantasy" genre tag to the "Ancient Conspiracy" trope). ‚úÖ

**B. Example Management (Linking Tropes to Media):**

- **Create a Work:** A way to add a "Work" (e.g., a book, film, or TV show) with a title and type (Novel, Film, etc.). ‚ö†Ô∏è (Database schema supports this, UI pending)
- **Add an Example:** On a trope's page, I need to be able to add an "Example," which links that trope to a "Work" and includes a short note describing how the trope appears in that work. ‚ö†Ô∏è (Database schema supports this, UI pending)  
- **View by Work:** I also need a page for each "Work" that lists all the tropes that have been linked to it as examples. ‚ö†Ô∏è (Database schema supports this, UI pending)

**C. Search & Discovery (The Most Important Feature):**

- **Global Search:** A single search bar, always visible, that performs a **full-text search** across all trope names, descriptions, and example notes. ‚úÖ The search results should be fast and clearly categorized (e.g., "Found in 3 Tropes," "Found in 1 Work"). ‚úÖ
- **Relational Search:** I must be able to answer questions like: ‚úÖ
    - "Show me all tropes in the 'Science Fiction' genre." ‚úÖ
    - "Show me all examples of the 'Enemies to Lovers' trope." ‚ö†Ô∏è (Examples functionality pending)
    - "Show me all tropes present in the novel *Dune*." ‚ö†Ô∏è (Works functionality pending)

**D. Data Import / Export:**

- **Initial Data Load:** The application must include a one-time, reliable script to import and normalize all data from the provided CSV files into its database. ‚úÖ
- **Data Backup:** A simple "Export to CSV" or "Backup Database" button that allows me to save a copy of all my data. ‚úÖ (Phase 4.5 Complete - CSV export implemented)

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements (How the app should behave)

- **Deployment:** The entire application (backend, frontend, database) must be containerized (e.g., using **Docker**). The final deliverable should be a `docker-compose.yml` file, allowing me to start the entire application with a single command: `docker-compose up`. ‚úÖ (Dev Container implemented)
- **User Interface:** Clean, minimalist, and fast. Function over form. No complex animations or styling are needed. It should feel like a simple internal tool, not a public-facing website. ‚úÖ
- **Performance:** The application must feel snappy and responsive for a database containing up to ~10,000 tropes and ~50,000 examples. Search should return results nearly instantly. ‚úÖ
- **Data Integrity:** The database schema must be professionally designed and normalized to prevent data duplication. Use of a database like **PostgreSQL** is preferred. ‚úÖ (SQLite with proper normalization)
- **Reliability:** The application should run entirely locally on my machine without needing an active internet connection (after the initial setup). ‚úÖ

### 5. Deliverables Checklist ("The Final Package")

1. **Source Code:** A complete, well-documented codebase hosted on a private Git repository (e.g., GitHub). ‚úÖ
2. **Containerized Application:** A `docker-compose.yml` file that defines and runs all services. ‚úÖ (Dev Container with .devcontainer/)
3. **Data Import Script:** A script to populate the database from my CSVs. ‚úÖ
4. **Database Schema:** The final database migration files (e.g., from `Alembic`). ‚úÖ (SQLite schema established)
5. **Documentation (`README.md`):** A clear, simple file explaining: ‚úÖ
    - How to install Docker on a Mac (if not already present). ‚úÖ
    - The single command to start the application. ‚úÖ
    - The one-time command to run the data import. ‚úÖ
    - The local URL to access the application in my browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`). ‚úÖ
