Updated: 2025-08-30 (PST) - ✅ Enhanced with Smart Dev Server Management

# 🚀 Dev Session Quick Start - Vibecoding Checklist

**Purpose:** A battle-tested development session workflow that maximizes productivity and maintains project momentum. This is our canonical process for resuming work efficiently.

**NEW**: Smart development server management eliminates circular startup problems and reduces environment validation from 2+ minutes to 30 seconds.

## 📋 Vibecoding Session Checklist (Order of Operations)

### Phase 1: Session Orientation (2-3 minutes)
- [ ] **Review Priority References** (in this order):
  - [ ] `Mission Statement.md` — What we're building & current completion status
  - [ ] `memory/memory.json` — Precise technical state and phase tracking
  - [ ] `PROGRESS.md` — Recent achievements and next logical steps
  - [ ] `archive/` folder — What we've already conquered

### Phase 2: Environment Validation (30 seconds) ⚡ 
- [ ] **Confirm Git Status**: `git status` and `git log -1 --oneline`
- [ ] **Start Development Server**: `python scripts/dev_server.py start` (or VS Code task "🚀 Start Dev Server")
- [ ] **Validate Health**: Server automatically reports API endpoints and database stats
- [ ] **Run Tests** (optional): `python scripts/dev_server.py status` or use VS Code tasks

### Phase 3: Context Deep Dive (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] **Check Current Implementation**: Read key files to understand current state
- [ ] **Identify Next Logical Step**: Based on Mission Statement progress and memory.json
- [ ] **Scope the Session**: Define 1-2 achievable goals for this coding session

### Phase 4: Active Development (Main Work)  
- [ ] **Implement Features**: Focus on one phase/feature at a time
- [ ] **Test Incrementally**: Validate each piece as you build
- [ ] **Update Documentation**: Keep memory.json and progress docs current

### Phase 5: Session Wrap-up (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] **Update memory.json**: Record what was accomplished and current state  
- [ ] **Document Completion**: Create phase completion docs if major milestone reached
- [ ] **Archive Historical Docs**: Move completed phase docs to archive/ folder
- [ ] **Update Quick Start**: Refresh current status for next session

Priority references (always check these first)

## ⚡ Technical Quick Start Commands

### Environment Setup (if needed)
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel  
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt pytest pytest-cov
```

### Health Check Workflow ⚡ NEW - Smart Server Management
```bash
# 1. Validate tests (optional)
./scripts/run_tests.sh      # Should show 1 passing test

# 2. Smart server start (recommended)
python scripts/dev_server.py start     # Auto health check included

# 3. Alternative: VS Code tasks (even easier)
# Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "🚀 Start Dev Server"

# 4. Server status anytime
python scripts/dev_server.py status    # Complete health report
```

### Development Server Commands (New Smart Management)
```bash
python scripts/dev_server.py start     # Smart start (only if needed)
python scripts/dev_server.py restart   # Clean restart for backend changes  
python scripts/dev_server.py stop      # Graceful shutdown
python scripts/dev_server.py status    # Health check with database stats
```

### VS Code Tasks (Recommended for GUI Users)
- **🚀 Start Dev Server**: Smart start with health validation
- **🔄 Restart Dev Server**: For backend code changes
- **🛑 Stop Dev Server**: Graceful shutdown with cleanup
- **📊 Server Status**: Complete health and database report
- **🧪 Run Tests**: Test suite execution  
- **🔧 Quick Dev Setup**: Tests + server start combined

## 🐳 Dev Container Workflow (Recommended for Teams)

**VS Code Setup**: Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

Benefits:
- Consistent environment across all machines  
- Auto-creates `.venv` and installs dependencies
- Port forwarding (8000) configured automatically
- Isolated from host system package conflicts

```bash
# Inside container (after build completes):
source .venv/bin/activate
make test                        # or use VS Code task runner
python app.py                    # Start development server
```

## 🛠️ Vibecoding Pro Tips

### Session Flow Optimization
1. **Always Start with Memory**: Read `memory/memory.json` first for precise state
2. **Check Mission Statement**: See what checkmarks are missing for next goals  
3. **Use Smart Server Management**: `python scripts/dev_server.py start` or VS Code tasks
4. **Incremental Testing**: Test each small change immediately
5. **Document as You Go**: Update memory.json during development, not after
6. **Archive Completed Work**: Keep root directory clean for active docs only

### Smart Development Server Management ⚡ NEW
Our new approach eliminates circular startup problems:

#### **Quick Server Commands**:
```bash
python scripts/dev_server.py start     # Smart start with health check
python scripts/dev_server.py restart   # Backend code changes
python scripts/dev_server.py status    # Health check anytime
python scripts/dev_server.py stop      # Clean shutdown (optional)
```

#### **VS Code Tasks (Recommended)**:
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "🚀 Start Dev Server"
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "🔄 Restart Dev Server" 
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "📊 Server Status"

#### **Benefits**:
- ✅ **30-second environment validation** (vs 2+ minutes previously)
- ✅ **No more port conflicts** - automatic cleanup and detection
- ✅ **Health reporting** - API endpoints + database statistics  
- ✅ **PID tracking** - clean process lifecycle management
- ✅ **VS Code integration** - GUI tasks for common operations

### Development Workflow Integration
- **Before Coding**: Use `python scripts/dev_server.py start` or VS Code "🚀 Start Dev Server" task
- **During Development**: Frontend changes need no restart; backend changes use `restart` command
- **After Changes**: Server automatically validates health and reports status
- **Session End**: Server can stay running for next session (saves startup time)

### Common Development Commands
```bash
# Smart server management (recommended)
python scripts/dev_server.py start     # Start with health validation
python scripts/dev_server.py status    # Check health anytime
python scripts/dev_server.py restart   # After backend changes

# Testing and validation
python -m pytest tests/test_api.py -v  # Single test run
./scripts/run_tests.sh                 # Full test suite

# Database inspection (useful for debugging)  
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('db/genre_tropes.db')  
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tropes')
print(f'Tropes: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}')
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM categories')  
print(f'Categories: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}')
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM works')
print(f'Works: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}')
conn.close()
"

# Git status check (paste into new sessions)
echo "Branch: $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"  
echo "Last commit: $(git log -1 --oneline)"
```
